// Example of creating a data race â€“ two tasks could be calling transfer at the same time on the same account
// NOT GOOD! Transfer $100 from an account with only $100 in it... two transfers could pass the guard statement at the same time, allowing $200 to be transferred from the account that had only $100 in it... we end up with -$100, which should not be possible
